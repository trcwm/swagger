# SWAGGER
## A Tool for programming ARM microcontrollers via SWD

This tool provides an easy way to program ARM microcontrollers and microprocessors using simple hardware.

Swagger is based on the Squirrel scripting langauge through which it offers easy extendability. In this way, support for additional ARM processors can be easily added without having to recompile the program.

Communication with the programming adapter hardware is done through the standard USB serial communications protocol. Any 3.3V powered board that supports this interface, such as an Arduino Nano, can be used. 

Note: this is work-in-progress.
